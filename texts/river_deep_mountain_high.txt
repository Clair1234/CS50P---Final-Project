River Deep Mountain High - Ike and Tina Turner

When I was a little girl, I had a rag doll
It was the only doll that I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper, deeper, deeper, let me say
Then it gets higher, day by day
And do I love you, my oh my
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, (river deep, Lord, mountain high)
Oh no, no, if I ever, ever lost you would I cry
Oh, how I love you baby (baby, baby, baby)
Well now, when you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy?
That always followed you 'round, 'round, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
And no, I ain't never gonna let you down
'Cause it goes on and on like a river flows
Lord, it gets sweeter, sweeter, sweeter, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter, baby, oh, as it grows
And do I love you, my oh my
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (river deep Lord, mountain high)
I wanna tell you that if I ever, ever, ever, ever lost you would I cry
Oh, I love you baby (baby, baby, baby)
And it get stronger, in every way, every way
And it gets deeper, deeper, deeper, baby let me say
And it gets higher, day by day
Oh, and do I love you, my oh my, my, my, my, my
(River deep, Lord, mountain high)
I wanna tell you that if I ever, ever, ever lost you, baby would I cry
Oh, I do love you, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love you baby like the water love the sink
And I love you, baby
Like flowers love the spring
I love you, baby
